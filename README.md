## ‚úÖ Features

1. Animate logos of popular social media platforms using Python Turtle graphics.
2. Customize fill and stroke colors for logos.
3. Simple and educational for beginners exploring Turtle graphics.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Each Python file uses Turtle Graphics to draw a stylized version of a social media logo. The core functionalities rely on basic turtle methods like `forward()`, `left()`, `right()`, `circle()`, and `begin_fill()` / `end_fill()`.

```python
from turtle import *
color("#1E4799")
begin_fill()
circle(100,360)
end_fill()
done()
```


## üìã Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Turtle Graphics module (comes pre-installed with standard Python)
